# pNotify Fix
In-game notifications for the FiveM GTA V mod

Reformatted to remove the nested folder, and added the resource manifest to the __resource file.

This should fix the majority of the errors like below: ~ Vampire
```Lua
Couldnâ€™t loud resource pNotify. :(

Couldn't load resource pNotify from resources:/pNotify/.

Resource loading for pNotify failed:
Could not open resource metadata file /resources//pNotify/__resource.lua
```
